I will go to Temple University in Jan 2024 for the Ph.D. Program in Computer and Information Systems. And I'm honored to be advised by Sian Jin, and do some research about high-performance computing, especially data compression.

Throughout my brief career, which includes a one-year internship and four months of full-time work, I have primarily worked as a frontend developer with a focus on developing spreadsheet-like applications such as Lark Bitable and Alidocs Notable. One of the biggest challenges that I tackled during this time was improving the performance of the formula engine in these applications. This particular issue was the one that I found most intriguing and engaging.

The design of Lark Bitable has learned a lot from the design of several databases. But it was difficult to "copy" some algorithm or design directly into this application, because of the limitation from Chrome, and JavaScript. Finally, Lark Bitable has fallen into the dilemma of reducing flexibility or reducing performance. Alidocs Notable also had the same problem. I felt uncomfortable about this situation. The decisions made by bosses often involve sacrificing one for the sake of the other, or vice versa. I am not fond of making such compromises. Instead, I prefer solving problems through algorithms or any other means. Pursuing a Ph.D. is my first attempt, and I hope not to regret it in the future.
